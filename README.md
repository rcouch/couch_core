couch_core [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/refuge/couch√Ç_core.png)](http://travis-ci.org/refuge/couch_core)
=========================================================================================================================

couch_core is a static distribution of couchdb using rebar. It aims to be
embed in your applications or be part of custom distribution of couchdb.

couch_core is brought you by the [Refuge project](http://refuge.io).

Based on the couchdb code it is tagged from time to time for stability
purpose. At some point some supported branch may appear.

couch_core differs from refuge by only focusing on Apache CouchDB. It won't
contain any of the refuge features like P2P nodes handling, ... .
Internally we are using it to test couchdb and as an example on how to
embed couchdb in your own applications. A working release example is
provided.

Note: couch_core is actually deprecated and is actually superceded by
the new version of [rouch](http://github.com/rcouch/rcouch).


## Features:

- Apache CouchDB based
- rebar
- relocatable
- Fully opensource. All the sources are on refuge GIT repository
  (http://github.com/refuge) under Apache License 2.

## Requirements

- OS supported: Linux, OSX, BSDs (windows support is coming)
- Erlang R14
- Curl
- ICU (if not built statically)
- Latest version of [rebar](http://github.com/basho/rebar) installed on
  your system.

An example of release file is provided in the `example` folder.


##Notes on building a truly distributable package

The package built above will still depend on some libraries from your
system, so additional work has to be done to distribute it to
older/newer systems.

1. CouchDB will depend on the ICU library version that was present in
   your system at build time. To easily bundle this library with the
   package, build with:

         $ make rel USE_STATIC_ICU=1

1. Check whether your package depends on Ncurses:

         $ ldd ./rel/couch/erts-*/bin/erlexec|grep ncurses

    If it does, copy the .so file to ./rel/myapp/lib/ or rebuild Erlang
    without this dependency.

1. Decide whether you need SSL support in your package and check whether it
   depends on OpenSSL:

         $ ldd ./rel/couch/lib/ssl-*/priv/bin/ssl_esock|grep 'libcrypto\|libssl'

    If it does, copy the .so file to ./rel/couch/lib/ or rebuild Erlang
    without this dependency.

If you copied any .so files in the last 2 steps, run this command, so
that your app can find the libraries:

    $ sed -i '/^RUNNER_USER=/a\\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$RUNNER_BASE_DIR/lib"' ./rel/couch/bin/couch
